        <p>Bears are large mammals that eat mostly
            meat and fish. Many bears also eat plants,
            bulbs, and insects.
            The polar bear eats mostly meat and is
            classified as carnivores, while the panda feeds
            almost entirely on bamboo and is classified as
            a herbivore. The six other species of bear eat
            both plants and animals and are classified as
            omnivorous.</p>
